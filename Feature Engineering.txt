Feature Engineering:


Checking the data
Creating new features
ML model testing on that features
Iteration Recreating features
Feature selection


Domain knowledge:
  i. Metadata
  ii. full forms of columns
  iii. numeric Units
  iv. create layout of feature engineering process
 

2. Data preprocessing:
  i. handling missing data
  - Imputing missing values
  ii. Outliers detection and handling

3. Numarical features:
  i. How many numeric features there
  ii. extract reality of numeric features
  iii. normalizing the numeric features
  - log transform
  - scaling the data
  - binning the data
  iv. handle the skewness of data

4. Categorical Features:
Type of categorical features:
i. Numerical (Binary)
ii. Ordinal

Encoding based on category type:
i. Label encoder
ii. one hot encoder
